Ole32:
To use the Ole32 skins you have to download "Reshack" to replace the default ones.
You will find the DLL in this directory: "C:\WINDOWS\system32\Ole32.dll".
Open it with "Reshack" and replace the skins in "Cursor Group".
Please make first a backup and keep it somewhere!

WinRAR:
If you use WinRAR, open the with "Reshack" the "WinRAR.exe"
and replace the one skin in "Cursor Group" with the "Copy" skin!
Please make first a backup and keep it somewhere!

Problem:
There is a problem with nVidia graphic cards,
they dont look good...
I dont know why, if someone knows why please let me know it!
On AMD(Ati) they work fine...
