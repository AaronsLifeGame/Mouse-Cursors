Hi! thank you for use my cursors.

To install them, you just have to go inside the folder of the cursor you want to install "dark" or "light", and you will find a file named install, just right click on it and in the menu press install.

I hope you enjoy them!

You can find a more complete versi√≥n with hd resolution and some cool alternatives in the next link: Coming Soon!

More Coming Soon for Linux and Mac!
